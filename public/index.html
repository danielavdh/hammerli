		<p>We are a small Partnership of Builders in South East London, 
		   catering for any construction requirements on your home, 
		   be that loft a extension, a garden extension, a new roof or bathroom.  
		   We have completed a large variety of different projects over the past decade, 
		   from simply painting a bedroom to refurbishing whole houses.
		</p>
		
		<p>Nothing excites us more than coming up with a new solution 
		   for a spacial concept so it fits your lifestyle and need.  
		   We are upfront and direct about costs involvevd and like 
		   to tell you the real cost before and not during the project.
		</p>  
		
		<p>We spend time with you during the planning phase as well as 
		   during construction, as we feel that communication with our 
		   clients is of great importance. We are acutely aware, that 
		   especially big projects are an invasion into your private space 
		   and have learnt that good communication is vital.
		   We pride ourselves on keeping a clean and tidy site.
		</p>
		
		<p>We do not employ a multitude of builders from all trades and corners 
		   of the world, but rather work with established traders with many years 
		   of experience. This way the clients gets the best of both worlds: 
		   the professional pride of a self-employed trader such as electricians 
		   and plumbers which leads to a much higher quality finished product.  
		   On the other hand our management and work in the process,
		   which ensures you only every deal with us and not with a whole 
		   host of different tradesmen.
